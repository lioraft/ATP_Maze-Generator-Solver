# Maze
Maze project for Advanced Topics In Programming course.
First part is generating maze alogirthms (with binary tree, randomized, and empty maze) and search algorithms in order to solve the maze,
such as DFS, BFS and Best First Search.

Second part is compressing and decompressing maze for client, implementing server-client, threads and thread pool.

This branch is for the src code, logical implementation of generation and solving. The GUI branch includes all the frontend of the game.
