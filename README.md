# Maze
Maze project for Advanced Topics In Programming course.
Project includes generating maze alogirthms (with binary tree, randomized, and empty maze) and search algorithms in order to solve the maze,
such as DFS, BFS and Best First Search. It is also implementing server-client by compressing and decompressing maze for client, using threads and thread pool.
The master branch is for the src code, logical implementation of generation and solving. The GUI branch includes all the frontend of the game, which uses MVC architecture and logs to monitor client-server interaction.
